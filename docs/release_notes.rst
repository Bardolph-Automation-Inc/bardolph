Release Notes
*************
Previously, I didn't really have any downloads, but I think people are actually
using this thing. Therefore, I've decided to update these release notes each
time I push a new build to PyPi. As time goes on, I might actually work
backwards, but for now there's just the latest update.

In all cases, you can also assume that there were some bug fixes and code
clean-up, although I don't log most bugs on Github.

=================
Implement "break" for loops.
