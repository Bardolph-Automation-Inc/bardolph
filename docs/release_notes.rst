Release Notes
*************
Previously, I didn't really have any downloads, but I think people are actually
using this thing. Therefore, I've decided to update these release notes each
time I push a new build to PyPi. As time goes on, I might actually work
backwards, but for now there's just the latest update.

In all cases, you can also assume that there were some bug fixes and code
clean-up, although I don't log most bugs on Github.

November 14, 2024
=================
Release: 0.2.0
After a long break due to unforseen circumstances, bring the code up-to-date
with the current state of Python and the supporting libraries/modules.

January 12, 2022
================
Release: 0.1.5
Bug fixes. Update documentation and fix broken links.

December 29, 2020
=================
Release: 0.1.3
Implement "break" for loops. Refine print, println, and printf.
