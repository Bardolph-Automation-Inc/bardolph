# Example Scripts

Note that most of these examples address specific lights, which means that they use the
names of lights that I have in my living room. Many of them refer to "Top", "Middle",
and "Bottom". This is a vertical pole lamp that has three sockets for light bulbs.

Scripts that access multi-zone lights all acces a light named "Strip". You can change
the name in the define at the top of the script.

You may be able to use some of these scripts by changing the define's at the top of each
one.
