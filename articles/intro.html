<div class="title">Introduction, or Why I Did This</div>

<p>Bardolph is intended for people like me: someone who wants to experiment with
their lights and perhaps use the results in a practical setting. Although I may
use it as core technology for some other project, this was never intended to be
a substitute for a commercial-grade, standalone product. There are plenty of
full solutions out there for controlling not only lights, but just about
everything else in the house. This is just something to have fun with and
perhaps to make your living room look cool.</p>

<p>The scripting language came out of my experimenting with a set of four LIFX
light bulbs. Although the lights support a richer API, before long I decided
that for my purposes, controlling a light was a matter of sending 5 numbers to
it. Through a very simple process, I could specify just about any color I
wanted, at the brightness I preferred. Given a light’s current color, I could
choose a destination color and a time, and watch that light smoothly transition
to its new color, as if by magic.</p>

<p>Before long, I decided I wanted to be able to easily edit a sequence of desired
states for the lights. A program would traverse that list and transmit each set
of controlling parameters to the lights. To do so, I wrote a minimal Python
program, relying on the LifxLAN library to make the code for accessing the
lights very logical and straightforward.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of color combinations used on my three-light pole.</p>

<img src="poleset.jpg"></img>

<p>In each of these instances, the hues of the three bulbs are separated by a
constant. None of the colors is specified explicitly; they are calculated
at run-time with simple arithmetic relationships.</p>

<p>Originally, I started with a basic list, containing hue, saturation,
brightness, and kelvin settings in sub-lists. All of the numbers are
unsigned, 16-bit integers, which makes them easy to work with. In Python, it
looked something like:</p>
<div class="listing">
colors = [
    [16384, 38000, 40000, 2700],
    [32767, 38000, 40000, 2700]
]

for color in colors:
    light.set_color(color)
</div>
<p>It's easy to see how this might become unwieldy.</p>

<div class="heading1">From Hard Coding to Scripting</div>
<p>Before long, I decided a simple language would make it easier to continue
experimenting. Because I just wanted to supply four color parameters it seemed
to make sense to use a simple name-value scheme. For example:</p>
<div class="listing">
hue 16384
saturation 38000
brightness 40000
kelvin 2700
</div>
<p>The parser for this grammar was very easy to implement, and before long, I
added time and duration values.</p>

<p>The next step was to apply the settings to one or more lights. Because each
light has a name which is a simple string, I added a set command to the
language. For example, if one of your lights is named "Floor Lamp", to set
it to a certain color, you could have:</p>

<div class="listing">
hue 16384 saturation 32767 brightness 49152 kelvin 2700
set ”Floor Lamp”
</div>

<p>A problem with these numbers is that they’re tied to the LIFX API, not to any
real-world coordinate system for the color space.</p>

<p>Therefore, I introduced the concept of *logical units*. That system expresses
the hue as an angle, measured in degrees. Saturation and brightness are
treated as percentages. The value for kelvin is always expressed as a
temperature in degrees Kelvin, although I really don’t understand what the
lights do with that number. Duration and timing are both expressed in
seconds.</p>

Conveniently, these numbers correspond to those you see on the LIFX
mobile app. This means you can use that app to experiment with the light, and
see beforehand what effect the numeric parameters in a script will produce.
Using logical units, this is equivalent to the above code:
<div class="listing">
hue 90 saturation 50 brightness 75 kelvin 2700
set ”Floor Lamp”
</div>

<p>In practice, I discovered that in most cases, few of the settings participated
in any given transition. Often, the brightness and saturation remain fixed.
Treating the settings as persistent values can greatly simplify the code. This
might lead to something such as:</p>

<div class="listing">
saturation 50 brightness 75 kelvin 2700

hue 90 set group "Pole"
hue 120 set group "Pole"
hue 150 set group "Pole"
</div>

<p>Because the 75% brightness and 50% saturation get re-used, the lights change
only their tone, while maintaining the same intensity and vividness.</p>

<div class="heading1">Timing: Light Changes as a List of Cues</div>
<p>I started this project shortly after completing an introductory Lighting
Design class at City College of San Francisco. In that class, we learned that
lighting for a live event consists of a series of states, where at any point in
time, each light is assigned a brightness and possibly a color. As a play or
other kind of live performance progresses, the person controlling the lights
triggers cues, each of which was mapped to a new set of states for some or all
of the lights.</p>

<p>Most often, a cue makes subtle changes to a subset of the lights, executing
them gradually. For example, when Romeo stands below Juliet’s balcony, you might
see the lights brighten on the two characters, while the rest of the stage gets
very dark, perhaps taking 15 seconds to do so. The slowness of the transition
prevents the audience from being distracted by the changing light, focusing
instead on the acting.</p>

<p>I discovered that slow, imperceptible changes work nicely with
ambient lighting in my living room. Specifically, my vertical pole in the
corner holds three lights. For much of the time, it supplies a
warmish-neutral tone to help fill the room with ambient lights. But later at
night, the lights on that pole serve mostly as background. Their colors and
intensity influence the feeling of the room, although most of the room’s
ambient light comes from other brighter, more neutral sources.</p>

<p>In the background, the lights on the pole continuously change their colors.
They repeat a cycle where each of the three lights has a different hue, and
those hues that are separated by a numeric constant. This produces nice color
arrangements, where, for example, you might get three shades of green, with one
verging on blue. Because the transitions are so slow, people in the room don’t
notice them occurring.</p>

<p>To achieve this behavior, timing plays two roles: when to make the changes,
and how long those changes should take. These are referred to as time and
duration. The time of a cue determines when it should occur.</p>

<p>Duration refers to the amount of time a light should take to transition from
one state to the next. For example, when turning lights on or off, a duration
of about 1.5 seconds gives a pleasing effect of dimming them up or down, and is
a much nicer experience than instantaneously turning them on or off. However,
that duration can go much longer. For exmaple, to extend that duration to 10
minutes (600 seconds):</p>
<div class="listing">
time 600
duration 600

hue 90 set ”Middle”
hue 120 set ”Middle”
hue 150 set ”Middle”
</div>

<p>When a light takes this long to go from one state to the next, the transition
is often so slow that it is difficult to see the change in real time. The
experience somewhat resembles watching the hands on a clock, where you can’t
see the hands moving, but after a while you do notice that the time has changed.
That inperceptibility that makes the lighting unobtrusive and effective at the
same time.</p>

<div class="heading1">Unusual Iteration Paradigms</div>
<p>During several months of using this, I found that most of my favorite scripts
ran indefinitely, in an infinite loop. To support that, I added a repeat
construct. Out of that rose several other kinds of loops, each of them having a
specific use case.</p>

<p>One interesting type of loop uses start and end points to control the
iteration. In this kind of loop, the programmer knows a desired state for a
light and specifies how many steps to take to reach that goal.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to start with the lights at 100% brightness and
lower them to 50%. Assume also that you want to do it in 5 separate steps, with
the brightness evenly divided along the way. The loop for this is:</p>
<div class="listing">
define start_brt 100
define end_brt 50
define num_steps 5
repeat num_steps with brt from start_brt to end_brt begin
    brightness brt
    set all
end
</div>

<p>In this case, the compiler interpolates the intermediate values, yielding
brightnesses of 100, 87.5, 75, 62.5, and 50.</p>

<p>In most programming languages I’ve used, the loop structures are optimized to
compute an end result, rather than interpolating intermediate states. Because
of that, the above code gets a bit more complicated with a traditional loop
structure. For example, one possible solution in Python:</p>

<div class="listing">
brt = 100
end_brt = 50
num_steps = 5
delta = (end_brt - brt) / (num_steps - 1)
for n in range(0, num_steps):
    brightness(brt)
    set_all()
    brt += delta
</div>

<p>Another special kind of loop focuses on hue settings. A *cycle* loop type allows
a script to cleanly rotate through the entire 360° range of hues using a
specified number of steps.</p>

<p>For example, consider a loop where the hue goes from 0 to 360, stepping
throough 5 colors. In this case, the hue settings
will be 0, 72, 144, 216, and 288. The code for this is:</p>

<div class="listing">
repeat 5 with _hue cycle begin
  # Use _hue.
end
</div>

<p>Note that the increment in this case is 360 / 5 = 72. If that increment were
again added, the hue would reach 360 and become zero. Instead, the loop starts
at 0 again, and the script effectively continues the cycle.</p>

<p>That scenario, where the hue cycles infinitely with values between 0 and 360,
can be coded with:</p>

<div class="listing">
repeat
    repeat 5 with _hue cycle begin
        hue _hue
        set all
    end
</div>

<p>Because each repetition of the inner loop starts where the last one left off,
the transition is seamless.</p>

<div class="heading1">Local Server</div>
<p>After a while, I had some scripts that I wanted to use every day. But
because many of them were designed to run indefinitely, it wasn’t practical to
use my laptop or phone to execute them. The obvious choice seemed to be a
standalone server.</p>

<p>Because the code is quite simple, it can run on a very cheap computer. I
started with a Raspberry Pi B3+, but eventually realized that a Zero would be
enough. I use a Zero-W, powered by an old phone charger, running as a headless
server in the corner of my bedroom. That’s how I control my lights 95% of the
time.</p>

<p>In order to make remote invocation of a script as accessible as possible, I
set up a web server to implement a 1:1 mapping between scripts and URL’s. This
makes launching of a script a matter of typing an address into your browser.
For example, if I have a script named “on_all.ls”, I access
<tt>http://example/on_all</tt> to run that script.</p>

<p>This reduces the front-end UI to a list of scripts mapped to URL’s. That list
appears with user-friendly names in a table that can be easily rendered on just
about any reasonable web browser. In my own experience, I can control my lights
from a laptop, iPad, phone, or TV, all of which have built-in web browsers.
Scripts can be bound to bookmarks, allowing quick access to everyday actions,
such as turning on all the lights.</p>

<div class="heading1">No Outside Access</div>
<p> The server runs entirely within the local WiFi network. This means that it
is not accessible from a remote location. This is necessary to prevent unwanted
outside control over one’s lights. Other systems are available to allow people
to control their lights from a remote location.</p>
